This release fixes some bugs.

**Improvements**

-   Improved French translations.
-   When image coding the boxes are colored to match the code color.
-   Auto-coding text allows you to assign multiple differing sections of text with the same code by using the pipe '|' separator. For example assigning the words *politics*|*politicians* with a selected code.
-   There are additional options in the view graph dialog. Right-click context menu on a line gives options to emphasis selected lines by color, thickness and style.
