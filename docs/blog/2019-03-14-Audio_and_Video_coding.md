Audio and video can be coded in the code_av dialog. One screen shows the video the other contains the coding and video controls. Coded segments are shown in the upper section of the pane. Hovering the mouse over a coded segment give you detail about that segment. Right-clicking brings up a menu where you can add a memo, play the video from that point, or delete the segment.
