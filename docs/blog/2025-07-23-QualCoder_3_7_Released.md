Hello all,

We are pleased to announce an updated QualCoder, version 3.7 is now available.

This includes a Window installer and applications for macOS. As well as the usual source code and install from source code instructions.

<https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases/tag/3.7>

My thanks to: Kai for updating the AI, other fixes and creating the executables; to Lorenzo for the Spanish updates and Joffre for the Swedish translation.

The changes are detailed below, and on the releases page.

Other languages
---------------

Added translations for Swedish (verified), Chinese (unverified), Japanese (unverified). Improved Spanish translations.

Artificial Intelligence
-----------------------

-   Improved robustness with AI models.
-   More AI models readily available for use.

Attributes selection
--------------------

-   Attributes selection in reports. Where attribute settings are created, these can be saved and loaded for quicker subsequent use.

Manage Files
------------

-   Ctrl C, Ctrl V copy and paste into other table cells.
-   Save and load table display profiles (Hidden rows and columns and column widths based on like/equals/hide parameters).

Manage Cases
------------

-   Ctrl C, Ctrl V copy and paste into other table cells.

All codings sections (pdf, text, A/V, image)
--------------------------------------------

-   More sort options for the codes tree
-   Show codes by colour range. This is another way to trim back the size of the codes tree.
-   There is now a *Find Code* button, either under the codes tree or in the header section. This is a convenient way to find matching code name text to help find a code in a large list of codes. It highlights the first matching text code name in the tree list codes.
-   All coding screens have a button to select a default colour for new codes, rather than defaulting to a randomly chosen colour.

Code Text
---------

-   Added option to auto-code using Regex, via a checkbox.
-   Auto-code sentences -- now ask you which text files you want to apply this function to, once pressing the auto-code sentences button.

Code Image
----------

-   Added Zoom In, Zoom Out, Rotate and Captions buttons.
-   Added options for captions to coded image areas.
-   Added ability to image code PDF pages.
-   Added tooltip warning about exactly overlapping coded areas. Suggest that one of them is sightly resized or moved.

Code Audio/Video
----------------

-   Added a button to save a video frame as a png.
-   Added a button to import the video frame into the project. For image coding.

Code PDF
--------

-   Added Zoom In, Zoom Out buttons.
-   Improved PDF image presentation (images, curves, lines, polygons -- good representation).

Report Codes
------------

-   Check box option to add a reference to the coded result.
-   On initial results text, right-click context menu on a reported item to add an additional code.

View Graph
----------

Added arrow-head to the Add Line function.

Code Co-occurrence table report
-------------------------------

-   Fixed error when selecting codes. The code counts did not display in correct columns and all the code names rather than the short list were shown.
-   Added option to select categories -- so codes of those categories are used in the table.

Happy qualitative coding,

with regards Colin
