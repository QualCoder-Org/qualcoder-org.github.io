We are getting close to the release of the 3.6 version, which among other changes will have an artificial intelligence modelling option. The AI component is optional and will allow the use of several language models currently available. This can be used to apply automated coding of text, based on a project memo, code names and memos and various prompts. Kai Droege has worked on and developed this for some time, and we have had a soft availability of this code to obtain feedback from various users to improve the installation and usage of the AI functionality.

There has been an impressive uptake of the 3.5 version that was released a year ago on 23rd December 2023 with over 10,000 downloads of the executables (as at 22 Jan 2024) for Windows and Ubuntu.

It is great to see that saashub <https://www.saashub.com/> which shows comparisons between similar software indicated that QualCoder is very favourably viewed compared to the very well known Nvivo software (as at 22 Jan 2024).
