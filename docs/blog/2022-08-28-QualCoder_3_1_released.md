Hi all, I have released a newer version of QualCoder:

https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases/tag/3.1

There are Executables for windows 10 or 11 and for Ubuntu 22.04.

Most changes in this release are fixing bugs, adding a lot of user manipulations to the Graph, export the Results matrix. More are detailed on the webpage.

For those who install from the command line or terminal, you need to also install the python vlc package (use py or python3):

py -m pip install python-vlc
