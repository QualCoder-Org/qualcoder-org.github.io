The latest update to QualCoder has been released.

Install from source code or use the Windows exe.

Details of changes are described on the link page. The major change is the ability to view, and code the text of pdf pages, presented roughly in a pdf format.

The second bigger visual change, is that the journals window is now a floating window. This makes it easier to enter journal notes while viewing coding, and coding reports.
