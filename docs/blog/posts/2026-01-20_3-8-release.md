QualCoder 3.8 is now released
-----------------------------

This is available here: <https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases/tag/3.8>

The manual for QualCoder 3.8: <https://qualcoder-org.github.io/>

The manual has information in French and currently partially translated in Spanish and we hope to expand on those in the future: <https://qualcoder-org.github.io/doc/en/>

This release will have executables (binaries) for Window 11, macOS (recent versions) and Ubuntu (and similar) Linux. These executables will be uploaded gradually over the next few days.

We have fixed errors and added functionality, where possible, to make QualCoder a better free qualitative software option. We hope you enjoy using QualCoder for your research endeavors.

We have a growing group of core developers, and thank Kai, Justin and Lorenzo for coding, testing, documentation and more.

with regards Colin
