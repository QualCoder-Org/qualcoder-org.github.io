Visitors arriving at the home page on the QualCoder WordPress site have increased substantially over the years, since the earliest versions of QualCoder were released on GitHub.

I guess this shows increased awareness and interest in the software. It is also impacted by the Windows 10 exe releases which I began creating with pyinstaller during 2021. This year, 2022, looks like it will be on track to reach 14,000 visits by December.
