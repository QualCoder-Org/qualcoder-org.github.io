The latest Debian package qualcoder-1.4.deb is available from https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder-Debians

This is for easy instillation on Debian based Linux systems such as Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint.

It may not be standards compliant but it works. It creates an application launcher or you can run it from the terminal via the following command:

python3 /usr/share/qualcoder/qualcoder.py
