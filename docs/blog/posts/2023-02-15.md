QualCoder imports plain text from Word, ODT, PDF documents. PDF importing can often be a problem and require editing after importation, as the PDF format is for print display not for text editing.

Now, with new projects, using the future 3.3 version, you will be able to open and **view the original text document**, from the Manage File and Code Text areas. The documents are opened by your default browser. So some will appear in the browser itself, and some documents will make the browser open the document using Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer, depending on which of these you have installed.

You can install the latest QualCoder code using the green download button and doing a manual install.

**Older projects**

Older projects will not have this option, but it can be added using database queries in the *Reports > Database queries* section

You will need to run sql statements that link the database entry to the text document stored in the project folder:

First save a copy of the project. This is a safe thing to do, in case your sql updates were incorrect.

Then run a sql statement like this example:

Lets say you imported a pdf called **mypdf.pdf** and that in the documents folder inside the qualcoder project folder it is there as **mypdf.pdf**

Then in *Settings* tick 'showids'

Open *Manage Files* and see what the id number is for that entry. Lets say it is **5**, as an example.

The below statement will update the entry to then be able to link and open that text file, when you use the menu option of viewing the original file.

update source set mediapath="/docs/**mypdf.pdf**" where id=**5**

Then run the statement using the cogs button.

Refresh *Manage Files* by selecting *Manage Files* from the menu. and check that view original text is an option for that entry.
