Installation and use on Windows have been made a lot easier.

I have created an exe file for Microsoft Windows. It was created on Windows 10 64 bit and also works on Windows 7 64 bit. Double-click to run. All python modules are included in the exe.

The VLC audio/video software does still need to be installed for QualCoder to work. https://www.videolan.org/vlc/

The QualCoder exe is available here:

The exe file was created using pyinstaller 4.2 and bundles python 3.8 into the exe file.
