Since I began releasing QualCoder, interest and use of the software has continued to grow. The first release was a 1.3 version on 17th April 2019 as a Debian install for Linux. Currently I try to release the software as a Windows executable (exe) and an executable for Linux Ubuntu.

It would be really appreciated if there were independent researchers who could write and publish independent and in depth articles about the QualCoder software. How is has been used, what the advantages and disadvantages are.

This chart is from data obtained on 9th August 2024. It shows executables downloaded from the GitHub releases, <https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases>. These executables comprise Linux Debian install files, Windows executables and Linux Ubuntu executables. The most recent bar comprises 1,049 Ubuntu executables and 3,590 Windows executables.

In the near future, further developments to the software will include more functionality such as:

-   Incorporating an artificial intelligence coding capacity, developed by Dr Kai Dröge, see <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrQyTOTJhCc>.

-   Adding a code organiser function, so that the code tree hierarchy can be shuffled around easily, to move initial codes and organisation into an improved representation of the concepts and theory that emerge, on deeper understanding of the data. A grounded theory approach.
