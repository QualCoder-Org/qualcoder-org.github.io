The latest QualCoder software, version 3.5, has been released. This included executable files for Windows 10/11 and Ubuntu 22.

Main changes are some bug fixes, a word cloud option and an exact text matches report where multiple codes are applied to the same text.

Some errors have been identified post-release:

The Code Audio/Video Segment right-click context menu does not work when using the Windows exe. (a brief flash then disappears). Download and run the source code instead, if this is a feature you need.

Issue with the python vlc module with Fedora 39. Unable to resolve this.

Issue with installing pyqt6 on ChromeOS. Unable to resolve this.
