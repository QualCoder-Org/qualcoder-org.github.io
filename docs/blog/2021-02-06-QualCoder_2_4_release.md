The latest release of QualCoder has been published: <https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases/tag/2.4>

It contains a major change from many opened dialog windows. to a tabbed interface with four tabs for *actions performed log, coding, manage* and *reports*.

Details of other updates are:

-   Extra explanation for text search in code text regards Regex.
-   Additional shortcut keys when coding:

-   Shortcut Q to Quick code with the most recent code. (requires text selection)
-   Shortcut M to memo a code. (click on the coded segment first)
-   Shortcut O to cycle through overlapping codes in situ. (click on the coded segment first)
-   Code in context of original file -- now available in *code text, code image, code av, graph and code reports results*. In the coding menus in *code text ,code image, code AV*, click on 'Show coded files' code tree menu option then in the displayed codes window, click on a colored heading to show the code in its original context.
-   In code text: the font size for the document text can be changed. (Future: this may be moved to an option for all document text in the Settings menu).
-   In Manage Attributes. Right click on 'numeric' for an attribute and there is a menu option to change to 'character'.

I skipped the 2.3 release as I could not change two minor issues after the code was released on Github.
