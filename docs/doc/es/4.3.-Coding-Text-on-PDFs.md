# Coding PDFs

PDFs can be displayed similar to the original PDF. The text on the PDF can be coded. PDFs displayed with QualCoder are not exact replicas, but re displayed with some limitations described below. PDF doucments take a long time to read, and larger PDFs will take even longer to load, so you may wait a few seconds.

The screen is split into 3 adjustable panes. The left-hand side pane contains the files list and codes tree. The middle pane shows the PDF representation. The right-hand pane shows the plain text extracted from the PDF.

## Font size and zoom

The original fonts for text are not used, it is too hard to extract and apply the fonts from the PDF. Instead the standard font used within QualCoder is used in the displayed PDF text boxes. There is a Font size adjuster to shrink the font size, to try to avoid text overlapping. It is set at -2, and -3 may be quite good also. The PDF can be zooomed in and out via buttons or key presses: Ctrl - and Shift +

## Plain text extract must match

The pdf plain text that is loaded when importing a PDF via Manage files must exactly match the plain text that is re-loaded when the PDF is loaded up to display the PDF here. This means that PDFs loaded before the 3.4 version will not match text correctly, and coding via selecting text boxes  is switched off if the text lengths do not match. Similarly, if the plain text is edited in any way and the text lengths do not match, the coding via selecting PDF text boxes is switched off. Display of the coding stripes within the  presented PDF  page may also look incorrect.

## Navigation

Move through the PDF pages by clicking on the page up down arrows, or typing in a page number, using the buttons:

## Extra functions 

At the top of the window are several buttons. One exports an image of the PDF page. The magnifying glass button opens a window that shows the PDF elements used on the page.

Also, at the top of the window are several check boxes to show or hide PDF elements of Text, Images. An checkbox will show all text in black which may be beneficial where there is light coloured text shown on a light background.

## Right-hand pane

The right hand side pane shows the plain text in the same way the text would be displayed in Code text. You can mark, unmark, memo the coded text, mark the coding as important and annotate text here.

## Central pane

To code, left-click and drag the mouse to select PDF text boxes. This can be tricky depending on the size and positions of the boxes. Then click on a code to assign the selection to the code. Further adjustments and be made on the right-hand side plain text pane using the shift left or right arrows to extend, or the alt left and right arrows to shrink the coded text section.

Right-click for the context menu on a coded segment. This menu allows you to add a memo, mark important or unmark the coded segment.
