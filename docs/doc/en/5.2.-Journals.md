# Journals
You can record your thoughts when coding your data in journals. Make use of these to develop ideas and themes. 
Journals can be exported as a single journal or all journal text can be collated and exported as a single file.
Journals can be deleted. Journals can have attributes.

There is a search option to search through journal text. The search uses regex symbols for more flexibility.

* A dot '.' is used as a wild card, e.g. '.ears' will match ‘bears’ and 'years'
* A '?' after a character will match one or none times that character, e.g. 'bears?' will match 'bear' and 'bears'
* A '*' after a character will match zero or more times. 
* '\.' will match the dot symbol, '\?' will match the question mark. '\n' will match the line ending symbol.

You can sort journals by name or date. You can add attributes to journals. You can show rows of journals with a matching text name, coder or attribute value, using the right-click menu function.

## Highlight journal text using markdown

Some markdown is available to highlight wording in a journal.
Using one to three hash symbols for heading levels. Single asterix surrounding words for italic text. Double asterix surround text for bold text.
