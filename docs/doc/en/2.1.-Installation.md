# QualCoder Installation and running instructions

## INSTALLATION 

For the manual installations (using the command line or terminal) I mention a specific release version, for example version 3.7. Please check on the [releases page](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases) for the most current version, as it may be newer. 

### Prerequisites
VLC is optional, but you will need it installed if you need to do any audio/video coding. Occasionally on some operating systems (e.g. Fedora) QualCoder cannot find VLC to use it. Optionally, install ffmpeg for waveform display, see https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows

### Windows

See [https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases/3.7](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases/3.7)

You have two options for executables created on Windows 11:

Option 1: There is a Windows installer on the release page called: **QualCoder.Win.3.7.exe**

Option 2: There is a standalone, non-installable exe folder called: **QualCoder.Win.3.7.Portable.zip** Download and unzip. It is in a folder alongside an internal folder. These both must be together or the exe will not run. Double-click the QualCoder exe to run, it takes up to 20 seconds to start. 

Standalone, portable version: <img width="100" height="60" alt="QualCoder portable" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6be1de98-8b47-4d57-b4b5-c34375e44959" />

On first use of the exe, Windows will ask you to allow to run QualCoder. This is because it is from an unknown publisher. It costs a lot of money to get a trusted publisher certificate - so that will not be possible for the foreseeable future. If you are uncomfortable with these warnings install from the source as detailed next.

Alternatively, install from source code:

Download the source code. Read and apply the section for Windows source code installation in the **Readme.md** file.
Remove the back-ticks that surround the command line instructions ` as these are used for display only.

### MacOS

**Install from App bundles:**

Make sure you have installed any macOS updates before starting the installation. Go to the System Settings app on your Mac. Click General in the sidebar (you may need to scroll down), then click Software Update.

Install QualCoder:  Double-click the downloaded dmg-file. Drag QualCoder into the link to your applications.

Start QualCoder from your Launchpad or by double-clicking the app within your applications folder.
We are currently not able to sign the app bundles, so when you first try to run the program, you may get a pop-up warning that QualCoder is from an unregistered developer or "QualCoder can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software." Depending on your processor, you may see one of these:

If you see "Show in Finder" or OK.  Click Ok.

If you see "Done" or "Move to trash". Click Done.

Next, go to Settings and select Privacy and Security.  Scroll down until you see a message stating QualCoder was prevented from starting. Click on "open anyway". You may be prompted to enter your password and may need to click "Open" again.  After entering your password, just wait for the program to open up. It may take several seconds.

From now on, QualCoder should start without issues.

**Install from source code:**

Download the source code. Read and apply the section for macOS source code usage in the **Readme.md** file.
Remove the back ticks that surround the command line instructions ` as these are used for display only.


### Debian / Ubuntu / Lubuntu / ZorinOS Linux

There is an executable file in the releases page for Ubuntu 24.04 for the 3.8 release. Download and double click to run.

Alternatively, run QualCoder from the source code:

Download the source code. Read and apply the section for Ubuntu source code usage in the **Readme.md** file.
Remove the back ticks that surround the command line instructions ` as these are used for display only.

### Fedora Linux

These instructions download the current source code directly from GitHub. Note: Fedora uses Wayland which may not work well with the Qt graphical interface. It is suggested you also install Xwayland.

Download the source code. Read and apply the section for Fedora source code usage in the **Readme.md** file.
Remove the back ticks that surround the command line instructions ` as these are used for display only.

There may be problems with QualCoder working with audio / video in Fedora.

### Arch/Manjaro Linux

Download the source code. Read and apply the section for Arch source code usage in the **Readme.md** file.
Remove the back ticks that surround the command line instructions ` as these are used for display only.
