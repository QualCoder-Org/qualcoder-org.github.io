# Coding Text

Select Code text from the Coding menu. Once text segments are coded, hovering the mouse over the coding shows the code name as a tooltip. Clicking on the coded segment also shows the code name.

_Select a file_

Select a file for coding from the selection list in the left-hand upper pane. Underneath are buttons that allow you to move to the next file, to move to the most recently coded file and to go to a bookmarked position in a file, to view the file memo and an Attributes button that filters the files based on their attributes. Additionally, there is a right-click menu of options, including sorting.

_Create a code_

Create a new code by right-clicking in the left-hand lower window pane. Codes can be assigned a colour by right-clicking on the code and selecting the change code colour option. There is a button in the header section with an artist palette image that will set all newly created codes to your selected colour, instead of random colour assignment.

Right click on a code for more options from a menu:  add a memo to a code, delete a code, renaming, adding a new code, and adding a new category, showing codes like (a certain name), Move a code or category, add a category, sorting.

_Coding text_

The easiest way to code text, is to select some text, then left-click with the mouse on a code in the code tree. Alternatively, select some text. Right-click to open a menu and mark the text with options such as the current code, recent codes, a new code, ir in vivo coding. 

Hover the mouse pointer over coded text to see information of the code and any memo. Coded text can be uncoded by clicking on the text segment and pressing the Unmark button.

Coded text segments can be memoed - through the right-click menu, by pressing 'M' or by clicking on the right-most 'notepad and pencil' button. Coded and memoed text is italicised.

Important coded texts, such as exemplars for a report, can be flagged _Important_ by using the right-click menu when on the coded text and selecting the Important option. The Star button underneath the codes tree toggles between showing all coded text and coded text flagged as important.

_Overlapping codes_

Overlapping codes can be difficult to view clearly. Overlapping sections are underlined. Mouse hover will show overlapped coded text. You can press 'O' after clicking on an overlapping section to cycle through the codes at that location.

## Annotations
Add an annotation (a memo for a text segment) to a text selection. These are useful for explaining acronyms and jargon. The text will become bold to mark the position of the annotation. To re-open an annotation, select some of the bolded-text and right-click to get the Annotate option. Alternatively, click the leftmost notepad and pencil button, or press the 'A' key. To remove an annotation, open the annotation and delete all the text.

## Auto-code

The top right of the screen has buttons for auto-coding text: 
<img width="247" height="41" alt="auto-code buttons" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d689c833-505f-49e4-938c-e392d4a2cc14" />


You can:

* auto-code exact text. An extra window will ask which files you want to auto-code.

* auto-code sentences based on a text fragment. An extra window will ask which files you want to auto-code.

* auto-code the current file using start and end text marks. You can use ‘\n’ for a line ending character. The start mark text is included in the coded section.

* Undo previous auto-coding

* A check box to activate Regex. This is a special function to apply a more flexible auto-coding based on wildcards and other functions. See [https://techearl.com/regex-cheat-sheet](https://techearl.com/regex-cheat-sheet)

Automatic coding is case sensitive. You must also define the end of a sentence, there is a default setting with a period and space. \n can be used also to denote a line ending character.

For auto-coding exact text matches, multiple sections of text can be assigned by auto code using the pipe ‘|’ symbol. For example, politics|politicians can be assigned to the same code at the same time (for exact auto code text matches only). There is an undo option to undo recently performed auto-coding. Although if the project is closed and reopened, the undo option will be lost.

The _Auto-code exact text_ button and the _Auto-code text fragment_ button have a right-click menu for more options. The default is to auto-code all text. There are options to autocode only the first matching text or the last matching text in the document. Another option is to apply the auto-code only if it appears within another code (for example, within a specific coded speaker's text). The auto-code exact text and text fragment buttons ask which files you want auto-coded.

There is an undo button to remove the auto-codings that were last applied.

**ERROR IDENTIFIED in version 3.8: When coding exact text and selecting multiple files,the autocoding process stops and does not continue with the subsequent files. 
SOLUTION: select only ONE file in the file selection step, or use QualCoder 3.7 version.**

## Auto speaker codings

The function "mark speakers" creates codes for every speaker in an interview or group discussion, and assigns utterances automatically. This allows for more focussed reports, only looking at certain speakers at a time. You can reach the function via the file context menu or the following toolbar button: 

<img height="41" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c742fad3-f34b-471d-8794-1919b7f5935d" />

- The speaker name must be at the start of a new line and less than 64 characters long. The following formats are detected: "Name:", "{Name} or "[Name]"
- You can select which names you want to include and even edit the label: 

  <img width="500em" alt="speaker selection dialog" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/055a2ffa-7ab5-40f6-a5e1-a9bb3a1c42de" />

- Each speaker will get its own code in the special category "📌 Speakers" at the very bottom of the code tree. The default colors are from the gray spectrum, to make them less distracting.
- However, you can still choose to hide these codings in the text window, so that they don't distract you in your own analytic coding. To do this, click on the "..." button right next to the coder name in the top left of the toolbar. In the following dialog, select the "📌 Speaker coding" entry and set the visibility to "hidden".
- The function "mark speakers" is also available in the "manage files"workspace.

## Maximise screen area
To hide the top control panel, click in the text area and press the 'H' key. To show the top panel, press 'H' again.

## Convenience methods for loading text files in the files list pane.

Some projects may have many text files and the view file dialog may present too many files to open. Right-click on the files in the file tree button to go to the next file, go to the bookmarked file or go to the file with the latest codings: 

* The next file alphabetically, 

* Select the file which was most recently coded, 
* Go to a bookmarked location in a file. To create a bookmark, right click in some text when coding and select the bookmark option. The bookmark works for only one project at a time, so if you opened a different project, the bookmark would be incorrect or might not work at all.

### Convenience buttons underneath the files list

* Load the next file
* Load the file with the latest coding
* Go to the currently bookmarked file
* Open the file memo of the selected file
* Use a filter function show only those files that meet certain criteria. These can be from file attributes, or if files are associated with certain cases. (Image below)

## Large text files
Large text files slow QualCoder. When opening a large text file (greater than 50,000 characters), right click on the file. A menu option allows you to get the first approximately 50,000 characters, subsequent clicks will open the next approximately 50,000 and so on. Approximately, because QualCoder looks for a line-ending (such as a paragraph or sentence ending) to more nicely section the start and end of text chunks. If the 50,000 chunk still slows Qualcoder, in Settings you can reduce this character size further.

## Modifying code positions

When in the text area, click on a code with the mouse (Note the code must not be overlapping with another code at that position). Press the following key combinations to extend or shrink the coded text segment.

* Shift + left arrow            Extends coded text to the left
* Shift + right arrow          Extends coded text to the right
* Alt + left arrow               Shrinks coded text from the right hand side towards the left
* Alt + right arrow            Shrinks coded text from the left hand side towards the right

It is always best to save a copy of the project before editing the text, to avoid the need to edit coding positions, in case after editing text the coding positions are shifted incorrectly. The key strokes below may help to recover the correct positions.

* Hash symbol - Shift + 3      Displays clicked character position.
* Caret symbol ^  Shift + 6    Shift code positions, after the clicked character position. May be needed after the text is edited (added or deleted) to shift subsequent coding segments by a number of characters. 


## Other shortcut keys for text coding

* Shortcut A. Press a to Annotate selected text

* Shortcut B. Press b to bookmark the current location in the current text file.

* Shortcut L. Press L to 'Show codes like', to show a shortlist in the codes tree.

* Shortcut R. Press r to select Recent codes. (Must have a text selection)

* Shortcut Q. Press q to Quick code with the most recent code. (Must have a text selection)

* Shortcut M. Press m to memo a code. (Must click over a coded text segment)

* Shortcut O. Press o to cycle through overlapping codes in situ. (Must click over an overlapping codes segment - denoted with an overline).

* Shortcut H. Press h will hide and unhide the top section of controls on the screen. This provides a bigger area to view the text and to code.

* Shortcut I. Press i when on a coded section to mark that code as important. Useful for identifying exemplars. Important marks can be removed by right-click and selecting Remove important mark. Important marked codes are bolded.

* Shortcut U. Press u to unmark one or more codes at a clicked text position. (QC Release 3.4)

* Shortcut V. Press v to code selected text with a new code made from the selected text. Also called *in vivo* coding.

* Ctrl Z. Restores the last coding that was unmarked.

## Search text

The coding text dialogue contains a search for text function at the top middle, with tick boxes for searching case sensitive and for searching through all text files. When in the text area, selecting some text and pressing the shortcut key ‘s’ will fill the search text box and focus on the ‘next’ arrow button for quickly looking through the document for the selected text. The search requires a minimum of 3 characters as a default. Right-click to change the default to 5 characters, or to search only after Enter is pressed. The Case sensitive check box will limit to case sensitive searching. The All files check box will continue the search through other text files.

The search uses Regex functions. 

* A dot ‘.’ is used as a wild card, e.g. ‘.ears’ will match ‘bears’ and ‘years’. 
* A ‘?’ after a character will match one or none times that character, e.g. ‘bears?’ will match ‘bear’ and ‘bears’ 
* A ‘*’ after a character will match zero or more times. 
* ‘\. will match the dot symbol, ‘\?’ will match the question mark. ‘\n’ will match the line ending symbol. This Regex cheatsheet might assist: www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html
* \b word boundary, ‘\bbound\b’ will search for the full word ‘bound’, but not ‘boundary’

## Moving through the text for one selected code

Underneath the codes tree are the buttons: forward, back and a grid icon button (to exit the function).

Select a code and then click on the forward and back arrows. These now traverse through the text document showing the selected coded text. All other coded text is hidden. To restore and show all the codes, click on the now coloured grid button.

## Show only important coded text

Under the codes tree is a button with a star symbol. This button toggles between showing all coded text and the coded text flagged as Important.

## Right-hand hidden pane

The right-hand side of the coding text pane has another pane tucked away. To open click and drag from the right-hand side of the window, or press the button next to the Help button. This pane contains options useful when coding. One button is when clicking on a code, the code name, code rule (memo) and random coded text examples from the project are displayed. The other button displays the project memo.

# Editing text

Text can be edited even after the text is coded or annotated or assigned (fully or partially) to a case. Sections of the text file or audio/video transcribed file will have sections of text underlined in green (case assigned), yellow (annotation) or red (coded) by ALL coders. 

**BEST PRACTICE: Save a copy of the project before editing an already coded text file. This is just in case the code positions are re-positioned incorrectly.**

When entering the edit mode, the entire file is loaded for editing. Other functions such as the codes tree and file list are deactivated.

You can select text that is not underlined and copy/replace without problems. You can click on a position (without selecting text) to then type, delete, or paste text. This can occur in underlined (coded, annotated, case-assigned) or not underlined (not coded/annotated/case-assigned) text locations. You will see the underlines shift as text is added or removed.

There are some limitations: It is best to avoid selecting sections of text to delete (or to type or paste over). This is particularly an issue if any of those sections have been underlined (coded, annotated, case-assigned). It may also be an The reason is that positions of the underlying codes/annotations/case-assigned may not correctly match as intended. If you have made a change that you think has affected these coded/annotated/case-assigned positions badly, exit the text editing window by pressing the Cancel button.

**Important note: The edits occur within the database stored text. The original text file is NOT changed.**

#  Categories and codes

Categories are used to organise codes. Categories are organised hierarchically in a tree structure. You can move codes into categories and move categories into larger categories. You can move categories and codes out of their current position. Codes and categories can be merged by dropping a code onto a code or a category onto a category. Right-click on a category or code to rename. Right click on a code to change the colour.

Categories and codes can be assigned memos. Memos can contain symbols such as those shown here: [https://www.alt-codes.net//](https://www.alt-codes.net//). See the how-to link to insert them - Laptop num lock on, hold the Alt key down then enter the number using the number keypad on the right.

## Reducing the amount of codes displayed in the codes tree

To reduce the number of codes shown in the code tree. In the coding windows (code text, code, a/v or code image), right-click on the code tree and select _Show codes like_ from the menu. Then enter text in the text box. This will then only show codes that contain that text. To show all the codes again, enter nothing into the text box and press OK to show all the codes.

A second option is to _Show codes of colour_.

Another button under the code tree - with a search icon - on clicking will search for the first code that contains matching text that you enter.

## Codes tree menu options

In the codes tree on the left, right clicking on a code opens a context menu for various options.

<img width="380" height="417" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c0c97fb-a316-4076-a5c1-1fddd575e1f1" />

###  Show coded files

One option is Show coded files - this shows everywhere you have coded with the selected code. Clicking on a particular coded section will open that code in the original context for further insight.

With show coded files, you can right-click on the coloured header section for more options such as adding more codes, removing the code, and export the entire set of coded segments to a text file.

## Accessibility and code colours

In the Coding menu there is an option called **Colour scheme**.

You can apply a range of colours to a range of selected codes, rather than rely on the random generated colours or a one at a time change of colours for each code. In this area you can also view how the code colours may appear to someone who has a variety of colour blindness: red-weak, red blind, green-weak or green blind.
