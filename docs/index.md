# What is QualCoder

QualCoder is free, open source desktop software for qualitative data analysis.

QualCoder can code text, images, audio and video, write journal notes and memos. You can organise codes in a tree-like categorisation scheme. Various reports can be generated. Most reports can be exported as html, open document text (ODT), plain text or Excel files.

QualCoder includes a set of AI-assisted features that utilise Large Language Models to help explore, analyse, and interact with data in innovative ways. Familiarise yourself with new data by exploring broad topics or concepts in an interactive chat with the AI. Dive deeper into specific aspects with AI-assisted coding and text analysis. And if you reach the point where you must synthesise and consolidate your results, discuss them in a code chat with the AI.

QualCoder is designed to be used as client-based software to be used by one person at a time. A second coder can use the same project on the same computer, or the project folder can be transferred to the second coder's computer. QualCoder is not designed to be multi-accessed at the same instance in time.

The most current QualCoder software is available from <https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder>. Software releases are available from: <https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases> These contain source code and executables. The executables are an easy way to run QualCoder, double click to run, just be aware that it can take up to 20 seconds to open. The minimum recommended screen size is 1024 x 600 pixels.

**QualCoder supports open standards**. QualCoder aims to support the REFI-QDA Standard, see <https://www.qdasoftware.org/> You may exchange codebooks and projects with your colleagues even if they do not use QualCoder, as long as the software they use supports the REFI-QDA Standard. It means that you do not risk your data being unavailable. REFI-QDA Project is not guaranteed 100% compliant yet. Further testing particularly for audio and video exports and imports and relatively-linked files is needed.

**QualCoder can be modified**. You can modify and adapt QualCoder to your needs, as long as you release your changes for everyone. This also means you can copy the software and give it to your colleagues or students free of charge.

Note: There is an ongoing problem with audio/video coding on Linux Fedora -- the software crashes.
