You can organise codes in a tree-like categorisation scheme. Various reports can be generated. Most reports can be exported as html, open document text (ODT), plain text or Excel files.</p> <p>QualCoder includes a set of AI-assisted features that utilise Large Language Models to help explore, analyse, and interact with data in innovative ways. Familiarise yourself with new data by exploring broad topics or concepts in an interactive chat with the AI. Dive deeper into specific aspects with AI-assisted coding and text analysis. And if you reach the point where you must synthesise and consolidate your results, discuss them in a code chat with the AI.</p> <p>QualCoder is designed to be used as client-based software to be used by one person at a time. A second coder can use the same project on the same computer, or the project folder can be transferred to the second coder's computer. QualCoder is not designed to be multi-accessed at the same instance in time.</p> <p>The most current QualCoder software is available from https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder. Software releases are available from: https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases These contain source code and executables. The executables are an easy way to run QualCoder, double click to run, just be aware that it can take up to 20 seconds to open. The minimum recommended screen size is 1024 x 600 pixels.</p>"},{"location":"#why-use-qualcoder","title":"Why use QualCoder?","text":"<p>Qualcoder is free of charge. Many qualitative analysis software requiring expensive one-time fees or monthly subscriptions.</p> <p>QualCoder is easy to use. It has all you need to perform qualitative analysis without the complicated interfaces of some alternatives.</p> <p>QualCoder works offline. Internet is not always available and QualCoder does not require internet to work.</p> <p>QualCoder is not tied to a computer. If you change workplace you do not have to worry about being tied to your former workplace's license or to buy a new license. QualCoder license allows you to use the software regardless of where you work or on what computer it is installed on.</p> <p>QualCoder is multi-platform. It runs on Linux, Windows and macOS, this means that you do not have to worry if you change operating systems, and it also means you can collaborate with colleagues on different platforms. See Note.</p> <p>QualCoder relies on the community. If you find an error or have a feature request or feedback, write about it on QualCoder's page on github https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder.</p> <p>QualCoder is always improving. QualCoder is actively developed meaning that newer, improved versions are being released.</p> <p>QualCoder supports open standards. QualCoder aims to support the REFI-QDA Standard, see https://www.qdasoftware.org/ You may exchange codebooks and projects with your colleagues even if they do not use QualCoder, as long as the software they use supports the REFI-QDA Standard. It means that you do not risk your data being unavailable. REFI-QDA Project is not guaranteed 100% compliant yet. Further testing particularly for audio and video exports and imports and relatively-linked files is needed.</p> <p>QualCoder can be modified. You can modify and adapt QualCoder to your needs, as long as you release your changes for everyone. This also means you can copy the software and give it to your colleagues or students free of charge.</p> <p>Note: There is an ongoing problem with audio/video coding on Linux Fedora -- the software crashes.</p>"},{"location":"#current-release","title":"Current release","text":"<p>The curent release of QualCoder is 3.8.2 available on GitHub https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases/tag/3.8.2</p> <p>The exectuable binaries:</p> <p>QualCoder_3.8.2 Windows 11 Installer</p> <p>QualCoder_3.8.2 Windows 11 Portable (Entire software in one file, slower to start)</p> <p>QualCoder_3.8.2 macOS arm64</p> <p>QualCoder_3.8.2_Ubuntu</p>"},{"location":"#leave-a-review","title":"Leave a review","text":"<p>If you like QualCoder and found it useful for your work.

I have many interests including clinical pharmacy, computer programming, research, statistics and clinical decision support. I completed a PhD evaluating computerised clinical decision support in 2014. When doing my PhD I used R as the statistics program of choice. This is where my interest in qualitative data analysis and the use of RQDA came from, which ultimately led to this project. I am currently teaching in post-graduate clinical pharmacy and supervising Masters and PhD research.  Google Scholar Publications</p> <p>Originally when doing my PhD I analysed qualitative survey data via thematic analysis using RQDA. After some installation difficulties with RQDA, I thought this could be reproduced in Python. I thought I would share QualCoder in the hope that it may help others. I generally work with Linux Ubuntu, and Windows. I work on the programming for this in my spare time, as a hobby.</p> <p>If you use QualCoder and publish your results, I would really appreciate it if you can let me know.</p> <p>======</p> <p>Since version 3.6 Dr Kai Dr\u00f6ge has been heavily involved with Qualcoder development, particularly with artificial intelligence features and more</p> <p>Dr. rer. soc.

Thanks to the maintainers of that project.</p> <p>People have asked that direct pdf coding be an option. I can see the advantage is when coding text, you can see where the text is located near other text and images on the page. However, this is quite a challenging request.</p> <p>The challenges: Unlike Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer or plain text documents, Pdfs are very different. They are designed in a print format and not designed to have text extracted. Some Pdfs may present the text as a full page image -- so text extraction is not possible without using optical character recognition software. This will not be an option in QualCoder -you would have to do this separately and import the plain text. Where there is text on a Pdf page, the text does not naturally flow from one bunch of words to the next like in a Word document. Instead the text is displayed in text box chucks with x and y coordinates to position each text chunk on the page. Text extraction, like using pdfminer, estimates what the next flowing bit of text is, based on these x, y coordinates. This can be good and it can be wrong sometimes too.</p> <p>I am experimenting with displaying a pdf, within the Qt graphics interface that is used by QualCoder. This uses pdfminer, so I work within the limitations of pdfminer and my limitations of re-interpreting a pdf and using pdfminer. The intention is to allow some text coding directly using a mouse with the pdf.</p> <p>So far, pdf rendering is adequate I think, to be able to perform text coding.</p> <p>There are quite a few limitations regarding displaying the graphics -- Images and Polygon shapes. Pdfminer does not find all the images on a page and some images appear to be like photo negatives. Often images have a mask to display a portion of the image and not the full image -- I cannot work this out yet. Other problems I have come across, is the order of displaying items, particularly, lines, rectangles, curves and images when overlapping. Curves are polygons which require extra instructions to display correctly. I have selected one font to display text as using Pdf fonts is not possible for now. Also, each character within a text box can have its own formatting (colour, size, emphasis), so most of this is ignored and formatting is estimated for the entire text chunk.</p> <p>This is an example pdf page with a lot of graphics (images, lines ,rectangles, and curve objects). My experimentation with pdfminer is on the right, the original is on the left..</p> <p></p> <p>Below is an example of a primarily text filled pdf. The rendering is a lot more similar to the original. The image on the right is my experimentation and the image on the left is the original. At the bottom of the image you can see I added some check boxes to show or hide some of these additional objects (text, lines, rectangles, curves, images) that are rendered on the page.</p> <p></p> <p>Next I am trying to select text. The approach for now is to drag the mouse over an area to select the individual text boxes that make up the text portions of the pdf. Then try to match those with the plain text import of the pdf. This will be a first approach to then apply coding to the text of those selected text boxes.</p> <p>Leave a comment</p> <p>Filed under Uncategorized</p> <p>July 19, 2023 - 12:05 pm</p>"},{"location":"blog/misc/#video-showing-installing-qualcoder-on-macos","title":"Video showing installing QualCoder on\u00a0macOS","text":"<p>Hello,</p> <p>This short video from Van Tran shows how to install the QualCoder software on macOS.

Thanks to the maintainers of that project.</p> <p>People have asked that direct pdf coding be an option. I can see the advantage is when coding text, you can see where the text is located near other text and images on the page. However, this is quite a challenging request.</p> <p>The challenges: Unlike Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer or plain text documents, Pdfs are very different. They are designed in a print format and not designed to have text extracted. Some Pdfs may present the text as a full page image -- so text extraction is not possible without using optical character recognition software. This will not be an option in QualCoder -you would have to do this separately and import the plain text. Where there is text on a Pdf page, the text does not naturally flow from one bunch of words to the next like in a Word document. Instead the text is displayed in text box chucks with x and y coordinates to position each text chunk on the page. Text extraction, like using pdfminer, estimates what the next flowing bit of text is, based on these x, y coordinates. This can be good and it can be wrong sometimes too.</p> <p>I am experimenting with displaying a pdf, within the Qt graphics interface that is used by QualCoder. This uses pdfminer, so I work within the limitations of pdfminer and my limitations of re-interpreting a pdf and using pdfminer. The intention is to allow some text coding directly using a mouse with the pdf.</p> <p>So far, pdf rendering is adequate I think, to be able to perform text coding.</p> <p>There are quite a few limitations regarding displaying the graphics -- Images and Polygon shapes. Pdfminer does not find all the images on a page and some images appear to be like photo negatives. Often images have a mask to display a portion of the image and not the full image -- I cannot work this out yet. Other problems I have come across, is the order of displaying items, particularly, lines, rectangles, curves and images when overlapping. Curves are polygons which require extra instructions to display correctly. I have selected one font to display text as using Pdf fonts is not possible for now. Also, each character within a text box can have its own formatting (colour, size, emphasis), so most of this is ignored and formatting is estimated for the entire text chunk.</p> <p>This is an example pdf page with a lot of graphics (images, lines ,rectangles, and curve objects). My experimentation with pdfminer is on the right, the original is on the left..</p> <p>![]](/images/with_graphics.jpg)</p> <p>Below is an example of a primarily text filled pdf. The rendering is a lot more similar to the original. The image on the right is my experimentation and the image on the left is the original. At the bottom of the image you can see I added some check boxes to show or hide some of these additional objects (text, lines, rectangles, curves, images) that are rendered on the page.</p> <p></p> <p>Next I am trying to select text.

With QualCoder you can code text, images, audio and video, write journal notes and memos. You can organise codes in a tree-like categorisation scheme. Various reports can be generated. Most reports can be exported as html, open document text (ODT), plain text or Excel files.</p> <p>Since version 3.6, QualCoder includes a set of AI-assisted features that utilize GPT-4 or other Large Language Models to help explore, analyse, and interact with data in innovative ways. Familiarise yourself with new data by exploring broad topics or concepts in an interactive chat with the AI. Dive deeper into specific aspects with AI-assisted coding and text analysis. And if you reach the point where you must synthesize and consolidate your results, discuss them in a code chat with the AI.</p> <p>QualCoder is designed to be used as client-based software to be used by one person at a time. (A second coder can use the same project on the same computer, or the project folder can be transferred to the second coder's computer). QualCoder is not designed to be multi-accessed at the same time. Accessing the project in a cloud location is not recommended, it may corrupt the database if a database connection is lost during any database updating processes. </p> <p>There is also a Wordpress site for QualCoder at https://qualcoder.wordpress.com/ and here https://qualcoder-org.github.io/.</p>"},{"location":"doc/en/#why-use-qualcoder","title":"Why use QualCoder?","text":"<p>Qualcoder is free of charge.

Internet is not always available and QualCoder does not require internet to work.</p> <p>QualCoder is not tied to a computer. If you change workplace you do not have to worry about being tied to your former workplace\u2019s license or to buy a new license. QualCoder license allows you to use the software regardless of where you work or on what computer it is installed on.</p> <p>QualCoder is multi-platform. It runs on Linux, Windows and MacOS, this means that you do not have to worry if you change operating systems, and it also means you can collaborate with colleagues on different platforms.</p> <p>QualCoder uses AI transparently. Unlike most commercial software, QualCoder allows you to see and even modify the underlying prompts of its AI features. You can also choose between different AI models or integrate your own. This gives methodological control back to us as researchers and makes QualCoder an ideal platform to experiment with new forms of AI-assisted qualitative data analysis. And yes\u2014you can also disable the AI features completely if you choose not to use them.</p> <p>QualCoder relies on the community.

It means that you do not risk your data being unavailable. The REFI-QDA Project export/import is still somewhat experimental and not guaranteed to work.</p> <p>QualCoder can be modified. You can modify and adapt QualCoder to your needs, as long as you release your changes to everyone. This also means you can copy the software and give it to your colleagues or students free of charge.

Vous pouvez organiser les codes dans un sch\u00e9ma hi\u00e9rarchique en forme d'arbre. Le codage de l'audio et de la vid\u00e9o n\u00e9cessite le lecteur multim\u00e9dia VLC. Des rapports de comparaison entre codeurs peuvent \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s pour le codage de texte en utilisant la statistique Kappa de Cohen. Un graphique affichant les codes et les cat\u00e9gories peut \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 pour visualiser la hi\u00e9rarchie de codage. La plupart des rapports peuvent \u00eatre export\u00e9s au format HTML, en OpenDocumentText (ODT) ou en fichiers texte brut.</p> <p>Depuis la version 3.6, QualCoder inclut un ensemble de fonctionnalit\u00e9s assist\u00e9es par IA utilisant GPT-4 ou d'autres grands mod\u00e8les de langage pour explorer, analyser et interagir avec les donn\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re innovante.

La licence de QualCoder vous permet d'utiliser le logiciel, peu importe o\u00f9 vous travaillez ou sur quel ordinateur il est install\u00e9.</p> <p>QualCoder est multiplateforme. Il fonctionne sous Linux, Windows et Mac, ce qui signifie que vous n'avez pas \u00e0 vous inqui\u00e9ter si vous changez de syst\u00e8me d'exploitation, et que vous pouvez collaborer avec des coll\u00e8gues utilisant d'autres plateformes.</p> <p>QualCoder utilise l'IA de mani\u00e8re transparente.

Les grands mod\u00e8les comme GPT-4 offrent une meilleure compr\u00e9hension du contexte et peuvent m\u00eame analyser des d\u00e9tails subtils et des significations implicites, ce qui est souvent crucial pour la recherche qualitative. De plus, l'utilisation de Blablador peut entra\u00eener des bugs dans l'interface utilisateur, comme des r\u00e9ponses en anglais au lieu de la langue de l'utilisateur, ou des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences sources mal form\u00e9es. Pour l'instant, nous recommandons Blablador uniquement pour des questions simples, si vous souhaitez exp\u00e9rimenter avec des mod\u00e8les ouverts, ou si vous avez absolument besoin d'une confidentialit\u00e9 renforc\u00e9e (voir ci-dessous pour plus d'informations sur la vie priv\u00e9e et la protection des donn\u00e9es).</li> <li>Blablador est gratuit, mais n\u00e9cessite toujours une cl\u00e9 API personnelle de la Helmholtz Society.

Le projet QualCoder est n\u00e9 de mon utilisation de RQDA pendant mon doctorat - \u00c9valuation de l'aide \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision clinique fournie par un logiciel d'analyse des m\u00e9dicaments. Mon logiciel PyQDA original, aujourd'hui compl\u00e8tement obsol\u00e8te, sur PyPI a \u00e9t\u00e9 ma premi\u00e8re tentative de cr\u00e9ation d'un logiciel qualitatif. La raison pour laquelle j'ai cr\u00e9\u00e9 ce logiciel est que, pendant mon doctorat, RQDA ne s'installait pas toujours ou ne fonctionnait pas toujours bien pour moi, mais j'ai r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que je pouvais utiliser la m\u00eame base de donn\u00e9es SQLite et y acc\u00e9der avec Python. La base de donn\u00e9es actuelle est diff\u00e9rente de l'ancienne version RQDA. Il s'agit d'un projet amateur en cours, peut-\u00eatre une passion, que j'utilise avec certains \u00e9tudiants en master et en doctorat que je supervise.</p> <p>https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/umore/colin-curtain</p> <p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KTMRMWoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en</p> <p>Fonctionnalit\u00e9s d'intelligence artificielle et plus encore : Dr. rer. soc.
